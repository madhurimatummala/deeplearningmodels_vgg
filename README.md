# Deep Learning Algorithms - VGG Models

Conducted an investigation of the performance of deep learning models for classification of breast cancer from histopathological images. It is a study of performance of deep learning models: VGG-11, VGG-13, VGG-16, and VGG-19. The models are used for breast cancer detection with the help of histopathological images, using BACH and BreakHis datasets.
